* <b>Setting Fuses:</b>\n
* Beim AVR ATMega168P sind die folgenden Fuses zu setzen:\n
*
* Boot Flash size=128 words Boot address=$1C00\n
* SPIEN=on\n
* BODLEVEL=Brown-out detection at VCC=2.7V\n
* SUT_CKSEL=Ext. Crystal Osc. 8.0- MHz; Start-up time: PWRDWN/RESET: 1K CK /14\n
*
* EXTENDED=0xF9\n
* HIGH=0xDD\n
* LOW=0xCF\n
*
* <b>Compile and create HEX files:</b>\n
* To compile your self developed app or the existing ones finished build scripts for Windows (AVR Studio) and Linux/Unix/MacOSX (Makefiles) is in place.\n
* You can use AVR Studio to generate the hex files or GNU Make, what you prefer.
*
* Windows:\n
* Load the existing project file in AVR-Studio, e.g. app-8-out\fb_app_8_out.aps and compile it with AVR Studio, for more details see the start-avr.pdf manual.
*
* Linux/Unix/MacOSX:\n
* Some default parameters are allready defined, if you like to change them copy the file Make.config.template to Make.config and edit that it matches for wishes.
* To create all .hex files you can type in the directory software/avr/ then:\n
* make hex\n
* you will find your hex file in the application folder like app-8-out/freebus-avr-8-out.hex
*
* <b>General notes if developing your own application:</b>\n
* If you develop an application you should not use an ISR in that application it can disturb the extreme
* critical timing in the EIB bus communication. I you need timers you should check instead registers if a
* special event was triggered. If you absolutely cannot avoid the use of ISRs make sure that they run as short as possible
* and check every condition you can imagine that it is secured that the bus communication is handled correctly.\n
* Transfers which a very error phrone are:\n
* * ACKS sent and received (at the end of a telegram)\n
* * Long communication like programming of group addresses and parameters\n
* * Receiving of data while a bit is read\n
*
* The following functions must exist in each application (take as example fb_relais_app.c):\n
* * \link fb_relais_app.c#main(void) main(void)\endlink\n
* * \link fb_relais_app.c#runApplication(struct msg *rxmsg) runApplication(struct msg *rxmsg)\endlink\n
* * \link fb_relais_app.c#readApplication(struct msg *rxmsg) readApplication(struct msg *rxmsg)\endlink\n
* * \link fb_relais_app.c#restartApplication(void) restartApplication(void)\endlink\n
* * \link fb_relais_app.c#setApplicationDefaults(void) setApplicationDefaults(void)\endlink\n
* 
* @todo complete list of conditions that must be checked
